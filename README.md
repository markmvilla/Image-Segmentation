# Image_Segmentation

This neural network can be used to find and segment images. 

I tested it using the Carvana Kaggle challange the first week it came out. It scored an %95 using the Dice coefficient evaluation.

The architecture used is the U-Net architecture, a well known architechture in the image segmentation area.
